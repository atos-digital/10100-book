# Libraries vs Frameworks

For skilled developers, the choice between libraries and frameworks hinges on the desire for creative freedom and expressiveness in code. Software libraries empower experienced developers to pick and choose components that align with their vision, enabling them to craft solutions tailored to their unique requirements. This flexibility allows for more creativity which leads to better code and happier developers.

In contrast, frameworks, while streamlining development and providing conventions, restricts a developers ability to create
and be expressive. The guardrails built into frameworks can prevent developers from writing code they way they want. Trying to do something in a framework that it doesn't cater for, can lead a developer to spend days searching the corners of the Internet for people who have tried to it and failed, and then spending days decompiling framework code to figure out how things are wired in order to get a simple deliverable done the way they want.

It is not uncommon to struggle to find talented young software engineers who are
prepared to work in these frameworks for example .Net and Java Spring. Some organisations are trapped in these ecosystems and will keep going with an ever ageing talent pool, while others switch away from these frameworks and benefit from highly skilled developers that prefer to work with libraries.

10.10.0 is built with highly skilled engineers at its core. Frameworks are unnecessary.
