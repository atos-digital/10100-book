# Libraries vs Frameworks

_"Libraries provide collections of pre-written code modules that developers can use to perform specific tasks, while frameworks offer a more structured approach by providing a foundation and imposing a certain architecture on the project." ChatGPT_

This chapter is best written as a personal account of libraries vs frameworks. My name is Kavi and
I have decades of experience as a professional software engineer. I know from speaking to many senior
engineers over the years about this topic, that they feel the same way about libraries vs. frameworks as I do, so I think this
account is more than just mine.

For highly skilled developers, the choice between libraries and frameworks hinges on the desire for creative freedom and expressiveness in code. Software libraries empower experienced developers to pick and choose components that align with their vision, enabling them to craft solutions tailored to their unique requirements. This flexibility allows for more creativity which for me at least, is the reason I got into coding in the first place.
Decades of experience with the freedom of libraries has taught me the good coding practices that prevent me from making a mess with the freedom that I've been given.

In contrast, frameworks, while streamlining development and providing conventions, restrict my ability to create
and be expressive. The guardrails built into frameworks feel restrictive and I feel are unnecessary (for me). But I can see how frameworks work well in preventing cost-optimised commodity developers from making silly mistakes.

I also have nightmares about trying to do something in a framework that it doesn't cater for, spending days searching the corners of the Internet for people who have tried to it and failed, and then spending days decompiling framework code to figure out how things are wired so I can get my deliverable done.
Highly skilled developers find themselves constrained by the
predetermined structure and conventions, limiting their ability to experiment with unconventional approaches or optimize code for specific use cases.

Basically frameworks are not fun and I don't want to work for a company that will make me code in them. I have
worked with organisations that have struggled to find talented young and diverse software engineers who are
prepared to work in for example .Net and Java Spring. Some keep going with an ever aging talent pool, while others switch away from cost-optimised developers with frameworks to highly skilled developers with libraries.

10.10.0 is built with highly skilled engineers at the centre. Frameworks are unnecessary.
