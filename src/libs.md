# Libraries vs Frameworks

_"Libraries provide collections of pre-written code modules that developers can use to perform specific tasks, while frameworks offer a more structured approach by providing a foundation and imposing a certain architecture on the project." ChatGPT_ 

This chapter is best written as a personal account of libraries vs frameworks. My name is Kavi and 
I have decades of experience as a professional software engineer. I know from speaking to many of my senior
engineering colleagues, that they feel the same way about libraries vs. frameworks as I do, so I think this
account is more than just mine.

For highly skilled developers, the choice between libraries and frameworks hinges on the desire for creative freedom and expressiveness in code. Software libraries empower experienced developers to pick and choose components that align with their vision, enabling them to craft solutions tailored to their unique requirements. This flexibility allows for more creativity which for me at least is the reason I got into coding in the first place. 
Decades of experience and good coding practices prevent me from making a mess with the freedom that I'm given.

In contrast, frameworks, while streamlining development and providing conventions, restrict my ability to create
and be expressive. The guardrails on frameworks feel restrictive and I feel not indended for a highly skilled 
developer - frameworks work well in preventing commodotized developers from making silly mistakes. I also have
many nightmares about searching the corners of the internet for people who have tried to do something in a
framework and failed, and then spending days decompiling framework code to figure out how things are wired. 
Highly skilled developers find themselves constrained by the
predetermined structure and conventions, limiting their ability to experiment with unconventional approaches or optimize code for specific use cases. 

Basically frameworks are not fun and I dont want to work for a company that will make me code in them. I have
worked with customers who have struggled to find talented young and diverse software engineers who are
prepared to work in for example .Net and Java Spring, and have eventually given up and switched to more
modern library based approaches.

10.10.0 applications are built around highly skilled engineers. Frameworks are not welcome.
