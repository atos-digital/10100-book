# Methodology

We have built a number of 10.10.0 applications for enterprise and share our methodology here. This is our method
and serves only as a suggestion.

In 10.10.0 applications, a squad of engineers engage with a client product owner to understand a business problem. 
There are no layers of consultants, analysts, etc between the engineers and product owner. Engineers must
understand the business problem and challenge any proposed solutions.

Once the problem and solution approach are defined, the engineering team will use Vision to spin up a project and
test environment within a day. The engineers will deliver a small set of features by the end of the week and
start a process of weekly feature demos with the client product owner, iterating the solution weekly and getting
the applicatoin into production and in business use as soon as possible.

Engineers are responsible for writing unit tests and modifying the end-to-end tests as part of their development workflow. By thinking about testing at the start, engineers can write more testable code which is generally higher quality and provides better automated test coverage and lower defects. 

Once the application meets its requirements, development can stop and the engineering team can move on to another
project. If the product owner needs futher features built, the team and pick it up ad hoc. There will be no need
for large complex and expensive upgrade projects the next time the codebase needs to be extended.
