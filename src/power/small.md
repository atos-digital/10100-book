# Keep code files small

Ideally two to three pg-dn should reach the end of the file. Where necessary this can be extended, but
files with thousands of lines are an anti-pattern. Consider breaking up the files or even creating a
new package to structure the code into smaller pieces. This is driven by keeping complexity low so the
next developer working on the codebase can become productive quickly.
