# Backend

Backends are written in golang and served by the golang http server. APIs are HTTP based and business logic is dependent on standard lib only. Other dependencies may be added for example database or queue connectivity, and so on.

- [Golang standard lib](https://pkg.go.dev/std)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for simplicity
