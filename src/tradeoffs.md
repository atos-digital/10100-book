# Trade-offs

Things that aren't trivial involve compromises. Trade-offs represent how we compromise between competing
factors. In software development we have no shortage of these factors and compromises, and in 10.10.0 applications
we want to call them out explicitly and explain the decision-making behind the choices we made.
