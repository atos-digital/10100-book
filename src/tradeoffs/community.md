# Community and open source vs. suppliers and support contracts

The [Open Source Security and Risk Analysis Report](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html) found that 96% of codebases contain open source. It is a misconception
that if you sign a support contract with a big IT supplier, that you have your "bases covered". Too often these suppliers will restrict your options to a
limited set of expensive solutions, that are often the root cause of enterprises' problems. For example a support contract might cover .Net and C#, or
Java and JDK, forcing you into these technology stacks, but such contracts are unlikely to cover modern languages like Golang or Rust or even JavaScript. Use stable open source software and join
their communities to support and leverage support, instead of relying on a big IT supplier
contracts that will cost you an arm and leg but are wholly incapable
of supporting all the modern components in your software stack.
