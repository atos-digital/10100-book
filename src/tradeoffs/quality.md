# High quality developers vs. cost-optimised commodity developers

We are unashamedly developer centered. We love working in well crafted codebases written by skillful
developers who take pride in their craft and their code - these codebases are easy to extend and debug. Conversely we have
experienced the drag of working in poorly written codebases created by commodity developers. Commodity developers may be
cheaper per day, but they take many times longer to write anything so their overall cost is higher, but also the code
they write is a drag on all future developers who need to work on that codebase. Cheap commodity developers are a
false economy.
