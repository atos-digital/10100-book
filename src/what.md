# What is 10.10.0?

10.10.0 is an approach to software development that aims to help enterprises develop and deploy software more quickly, get more years out of their apps, and eliminate manual work.

<!-- We are a group of digital native software developers working in enterprise. We developed 10.10.0 as a style of application to solve a set of software development problems that we think are fairly
unique to enterprise, and that seem to keep holding enterprise back. Here we refer to enterprise as large organisations that have been around for many decades (much older than digital natives such as Meta and Alphabet for example) and have been building IT systems for as long as IT existed (if you
own a mainframe, the shoe fits...). To compound the problem, large enterprises have
typically acquired many smaller organisations over their lifetimes leaving them with complex
heterogeneous IT ecosystems. Enterprises have responded by evolving complex IT organizations to balance these needs - for example large architecture and security groups, central and distributed policy making, and so on. In addition to the technology complexity, many of these enterprises also operate in complex business environments such as regulation for example in healthcare, the need for complex
plant and machinery, social requirements for such as supporting physical retail for customers
without internet access, and so on.

We believe that enterprises are the backbone of humanity. They are the healthcare providers that look after us when we're sick, the governments that manage our local and national services,
the banks that hold our money for us, and so on. They chronically under-invest in technology
because their services are built on things like cleaners, doctors, trucks, buildings,
etc. In contrast, what we call digital natives are much younger organisations that are entirely digital, have global scale sometimes billions of users, and have invested significantly in technology as their business models are built on it. The technology that these digital natives have built are typically available as open source (thankyou digital natives), and solve many of the problems that enterprises grapple with. However, lifting-and-shifting digital natives' technology into enterprise is not a good idea since, it in its entirely, it is built for a different audience - as mentioned before larger scales, fully digital, less regulation, and so on.

This is why we have curated and configured a stack of technology that brings the key benefits
of this technology to the enterprise. The benefits are conveniently summarised in the name :-) -->
