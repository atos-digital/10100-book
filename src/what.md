# What is 10.10.0?

We are a group of digital native software developers working in enterprise. We developed 10.10.0 as a style of application to solve a set of software development problems that we think are fairly
unique to enterprise, and that seem to keep holding enterprise back. Here we refer to enterprise as large organisations that have been around for many decades (much older than digital natives such as Meta and Alphabet for example) and have been building IT systems for as long as IT existed (if you
own a mainframe, the shoe fits...). To compound the problem, large enterprises have
typically acquired many smaller organisations over their lifetimes leaving them with complex
hetrogeneous IT ecosystems. Enterprises have responded by evolving complex IT organizations to balance these needs - for example large architecture and security groups, central and distributed policy making, and so on. In addition to the technology complexity, many of these enterprises also operate in complex business environments such as regulation for example in healthcare, the need for complex
plant and machinery, social requirements for such as supporting physical retail for customers 
without internet access, and so on. 

We belive that enterprises are the backbone of humanity. They are the healthcare providers that look after us when we're sick, the governments that manage our local and national services, 
the banks that hold our money for us, and so on. They chronically under-invest in technology 
because their services are built on things like cleaners, doctors, trucks, buildings,
etc. In contast, what we call digital natives are much younger organisations that are entirely digital, have global scale sometimes billions of users, and have invested significantly in technology as their business models are built on it. The technology that these digital natives have built are typically available as open source (thankyou digital natives), and solve many of the problems that enterprises grapple with. However, lifting-and-shifting digital natives' technology into enterprise is not a good idea since, it in its entirely, it is built for a different audience - as mentioned before larger scales, fully digital, less regulation, and so on.

This is why we have curated and configured a stack of technology that brings the key benefits
of this technology to the enterprise. The benefits are conveniently summarised in the name :-)

- _Rapid application development (10 weeks to develop)_ - freeing up developers to work at the speed they want to go. Interacting directly with business users. Building prototypes in days and deploying working software in weeks. Iterating at the speed of light, using the software to drive business
change instead of the all too familar problem of software holding business back. 
This is not a new idea and we see many enterprises succeeding. But unfortunately many
fail, spending a lot of money on the wrong things (like the very expensive ecosystem
of applicatoin suppliers that have built up around enterprise, a particular bugbear of ours).
  
- _Evergreen software (10 years evergreen, yes we know its an oxymoron but its catchy)_ - with the right
technology stack and design choices, we can build software that performs its function and
stays up to date without the need for (much) itervention after it has been built. This is a particularly attractive idea in enterprise because they often "finish" an applicatoin and 
then do not want to keep teams feeding and watering those application until a new feature comes along.Today we see teams having to spend months upgrading software before adding new features to
an application that is mission critical but has had no need for development in years.

- _Zero ops_ - this involves investing in automation to minimise and eliminate low value manual tasks - toil in SRE parlance. This includes toil in testing and deployment, day-to-day operations, scaling, and so on. The idea is that machines should do this toil.
Unfortunately a culture of cutting corners in enterprise has led to under-investment in automation 
and armies of low value engineers keeping the lights on. Zero ops not optional, you cannot cut 
it out of the software development process. Engineers should do high value work only.
