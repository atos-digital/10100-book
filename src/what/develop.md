# 10 weeks to develop

Freeing up developers to work at the speed they want to go. Interacting directly with business users. Building prototypes in days and deploying working software in weeks. Iterating at the speed of light, using the software to drive business
change instead of the all too familiar problem of software holding business back.
This is not a new idea and we see many enterprises succeeding. But unfortunately many
fail, spending a lot of money on the wrong things (like the very expensive ecosystem
of application suppliers that have built up around enterprise, a particular bugbear of ours).
