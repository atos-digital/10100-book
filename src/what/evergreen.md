# 10+ years evergreen

Yes we know its an oxymoron but its catchy with the right
technology stack and design choices, we can build software that performs its function and
stays up to date without the need for (much) intervention after it has been built. This is a particularly attractive idea in enterprise because they often "finish" an application and
then do not want to keep teams feeding and watering those application until a new feature comes along.Today we see teams having to spend months upgrading software before adding new features to
an application that is mission critical but has had no need for development in years.
