# Zero operations

This involves investing in automation to minimise and eliminate low value manual tasks toil in SRE terms. This includes toil in testing and deployment, day-to-day operations, scaling, and so on. The idea is that machines should do this toil.
Unfortunately a culture of cutting corners in enterprise has led to under-investment in automation
and armies of low value engineers keeping the lights on. Zero ops not optional, you cannot cut
it out of the software development process. Engineers should do high value work only.
